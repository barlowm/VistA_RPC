The list of all routines ordered alphabetically is listed in the [OSEHRA Documentation](http://code.osehra.org/dox/routines.html)
However this list isn't all that useful unless you know what the RPC Code (2-4 letters) stands for.
Still looking for a mapping of that.

Though it looks like anything with the same preceeding letters falls under the same category:
e.g. SD is for scheduling
SD08STOP is (probably) a STOP code for a scheduled appointment
SD08SUPP is also for scheduling... But don't know what at this point.

But the VistA-M source from github takes up ove 5 GB and a local copy of that is on: D:\WebRoot\_CODE_\_VistA_\VistA-M


Although the [Packages.CSV](https://github.com/OSEHRA/VistA-M/blob/master/Packages.csv) file does have some mapping information

For example:
<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Package Name</th><th>Directory Name</th><th>Prefixes</th><th>File Numbers</th><th>File Names</th></tr>
<tr><td>SCHEDULING</td><td>Scheduling</td><td>SD</td><td>40.7</td><td>CLINIC STOP</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>SC</td><td>40.9</td><td>LOCATION TYPE</td></tr>
</table>

Both SD and SC fall under Scheduling and all scheduling routines fall under the [Scheduling/Routines](https://github.com/OSEHRA/VistA-M/tree/master/Packages/Scheduling/Routines) section of the repo

*Note that the VA Software Document Library brings you to a page with a menu and in most cases it looks like it's the ["Clinical Section"](http://www.va.gov/vdl/section.asp?secid=1) that will have all the information (again for example, Clinical Section lists ["Scheduling"](http://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=100) )*
